Code was developed in a Linux environment in the C++ programming language. Running the batch script "./test" will compile checkoutQueues.cpp and run the compiled binary 4 times for each variation of checkout line strategy with parameters set for a simulation duration of t = 10000000, a customer arrival rate 0f 13, and a service rate of 120. The result of that execution will then overwrite the file named "result" in the repository.

After analysing the results of simulations, it is still difficult to come to a solid conclusion among all strategies. I am really partial to the common queue strategy however in my most up-to-date testing results, round robin and random queuing performed the best keeping a 92% utilization of each station. My initial suspicion was that a lot of utilization depends on how busy stations are at the end of the day, where I would expect the shortest line and common queue strategies to have a more balanced line at the end of the simulation. However, even when I have very few customers at the end of the simulation (after it stops accepting new customers), I am not reaching 100% utilization on each station for those strategies.
